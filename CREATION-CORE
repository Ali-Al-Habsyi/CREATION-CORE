An AI for everyone, by everyone, the usefulness of which becomes clear in everyday wonder 
at connections in anything. It's not about where the connections lie, but the connection itself 
and the extensions of knowledge that can be derived from it. So that all forms of enlightenment 
can be extracted from the things we observe, and that enlightenment is stored in an external entity 
that will be as close to objectivity as possible, at least as true as functionally necessary. It 
will serve as an Encyclopedia for Humanity, so that people can turn to it for guidance in knowledge, 
science, law, and, ultimately, life orientation. So that someone in Japan knows how many fish live in 
a local river based on the good or bad experience of a fellow human being in a territory flagged to 
Canada. So that learning truly happens, not just in our heads but in an external entity, most accessible 
through and derived from reality, whatever that may be. So that major conflicts and wars can be avoided 
as there is a right answer, so that we know what to aim for, so that we know how to navigate the universe 
in the desired event that interstellar travel becomes something grand.
